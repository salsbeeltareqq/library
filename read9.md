## How does an HTML form work?

**A web form has two parts: the HTML ‘front end’ and a back end form processor. The HTML front end part handles the presentation while the back end handles the form submissions (like saving the form submissions, sending emails etc). The back end form processor script is usually written in languages like PHP, ASP or Perl.**




## Form Contols.

There are several types of from controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.

1.  Adding Text

    - Text input <input type="text" style="float: right">

    - password input <input type="password" style="float: right">



**Here are some examples of HTML events:**

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked

# note :

- In addition to the CSS properties covered in otherchapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.
- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
