### Unwritten rules.

1. psychological safety.

the behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

2. Equal Amount of speaking.

Each team member have to get an equal portion of time to discuss their ideas, without being judged over them.

3. Respect.

All team members should and have to respect each other and their leadership, this respect will lead to having better conversation between the members and find solutions will be more easy.
