  When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server

  How PageS uSe Structure 
  * Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the  article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper 1
   * The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website. 2
   * Now think about a very different type of document â€” an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.3

   # h2 'note1'

    Anything written between the <body> tags will appear in the main browser window .

> # h2 'note2'

You may know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one .

> # h2 'note3 '

 page to another quickly and easily. A markup language allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document.

  Whenever you want to collect information from  X visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.

Each form control is given a name, and the text the  X user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
